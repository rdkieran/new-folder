# New Folder
After a long time not doing a lot of coding, I've decided to get back at it. Life is simple and empty, my flat is small and cold. I miss being good at things, so I've decided that in the absence of any artistic motivation, I'll learn to solve puzzles and do coding instead.

New Folder is for all the little things. Something to quantify my progress from this point as I try to get good at coding.
